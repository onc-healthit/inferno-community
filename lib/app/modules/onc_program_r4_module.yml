      - name: Discovery and Registration
        overview: |
          Servers must provide the ability to register Inferno as a SMART on FHIR application.  This set of tests provides the tester with
          registration information to be entered into the system under test.  Once registered, the tester should be provided
          a *Client ID*, and optionally a *Client Secret*, to enter into Inferno.  This set of tests also requires the server to demonstrate
          the ability to provide required service metatdata through the discovery endpoints, including OAuth endpoints,
          supported resources and searches.
        input_instructions: |
          Register Inferno as a SMART on FHIR app with the following *Launch URI* and *Redirect URI*.  You may either register the app as 
          a confidential client or a public client.  Enter in the *Client ID*, and the *Client Secret* if applicable, as provided by the
          authentication system through a manual registration process.

      - name: Standalone Patient App
        overview: |
          Demonstrate the ability to perform a Patient Standalone Launch to a [SMART on FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) client with a patient context,
          refresh token, and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) identity token.  After launch, a simple Patient resource read is performed
          on the patient in context.  The access token is then refreshed, and the Patient resource is read using the new
          access token to ensure that the refresh was successful.  Finally, the authentication information provided by OpenID Connect is decoded and validated.
        input_instructions: |
          Enter in the appropriate scope to enable patient-level access to all relevant resources.  In addition, support for the 
          OpenID Connect (`openid fhirUser`), refresh tokens (`offline_access`), and patient context (`launch/patient`) are required.

      - name: EHR Practitioner App
        overview: |
          Demonstrate the ability to perform an EHR launch to a [SMART on FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) client with a patient context,
          refresh token, and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) identity token.  After launch, a simple Patient resource read is performed
          on the patient in context.  The access token is then refreshed, and the Patient resource is read using the new
          access token to ensure that the refresh was successful.  Finally, the authentication information provided by OpenID Connect is decoded and validated.

        input_instructions: |
          Enter in the appropriate scope to enable user-level access to all relevant resources.  In addition, support for the 
          OpenID Connect (`openid fhirUser`), refresh tokens (`offline_access`), and EHR context (`launch`) are required.  This test
          expects that the EHR will launch the application with a patient context.

          After `execute` is pressed, Inferno will wait for the system under test to launch the application.

          For each of the relevant USCDI data elements provided in the conformance statement, this test executes the [required supported searches](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/Conformance-server.html)
          as defined by the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.  The test begins by searching by Patient provided in the most recent SMART App Launch performed by Inferno.  It uses results returned from that
          query to generate other queries and checks that the results are consistent with the provided search parameters.  It then performs a read on each Resource returned and validates the response against the 
          relevant [profile](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/profiles.html) as currently defined in the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.
