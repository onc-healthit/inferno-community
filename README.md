# Inferno Community Edition (Legacy)

## ⚠️ This repository has been archived. The tests provided by Inferno Community Edition have been migrated to the [Inferno Framework GitHub organization](https://github.com/inferno-framework).

Inferno is an open source tool for testing data exchanges enabled by the [Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](http://hl7.org/fhir/) standard. This repository
contains the Inferno test tool, as well as the Inferno Community Edition set
of tests which provides server testing for a number of FHIR Implementation
Guides (IGs). Users can either run existing Community Edition tests from this
repository, or author their own tests using Inferno's open testing language.

If you are interested in testing health IT systems for conformance to the ONC
Standarized API for Patient and Population Service (§170.315(g)(10))
criterion, please visit the [Inferno Program Edition repository](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program). Testing
related to this ONC certification criteria is currently maintained separately.

[The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT
(ONC)](https://www.healthit.gov) and [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/) are
developing Inferno with the goal of accelerating adoption of open
standardized health data APIs by providing robust and accessible testing
tools. Inferno is an open source project and welcomes contributions from the
health IT community.

## Inferno Community Edition Tests

The Inferno team is actively developing tests for a number of different
FHIR-enabled use cases. This repository currently contains testing for the
following implementation guides:

* US Core v3.1.1
* SMART App Launch Framework v1.0.0
* International Patient Summary v1.0.0
* FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR) v1.0.1 (via integration with BDT)
* SMART Scheduling Links (Draft Proposal)

For end-to-end testing of the ONC Standarized API for Patient and Population
Services criteria, please visit the [Inferno Program
Edition](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program) repository.

## Using Inferno

If you are new to FHIR or SMART-on-FHIR, you may want to review the [Inferno Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide).

## Installation and Deployment

### Docker Installation

Docker is the recommended installation method for Windows devices and can also be used on Linux and MacOS hosts.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the host platform as well as the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) tool (which may be included in the distribution, as is the case for Windows and MacOS).
2. Download the [latest release of the `inferno` project](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/releases) to your local computer on a directory of your choice.
3. Open a terminal in the directory where the project was downloaded (above).
4. Run the command `docker-compose up` to start the server. This will automatically build the Docker image and launch both the ruby server (using unicorn) and an NGINX web server.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:4567 to find the running application.

If the docker image gets out of sync with the underlying system, such as when new dependencies are added to the application, you need to run `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the containers.

Check out the [Troubleshooting Documentation](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Troubleshooting) for help.

### Native Installation

Inferno can installed and run locally on your machine.  Install the following dependencies first:

* [Ruby 2.5+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Ruby Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

And run the following commands from the terminal:

```sh
# MacOS or Linux
git clone https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno
cd inferno
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
bundle exec rackup
```

Inferno can then be accessed at http://localhost:4567 in a web browser.

If you would like to use a different port it can be specified when calling `rackup`.  For example, the following command would host Inferno on port 3000:

```sh
rackup -p 3000
```

## Deploying Inferno in a Server Environment

Inferno's default configuration is designed to be lightweight and
run on the users host machine.  If you would like to run a shared instance
of Inferno, you can use the docker-compose configuration provided in
`docker-compose.postgres.yml`, which attaches Inferno to a Postgres
database to provide more stability when multiple tests are run
simultaniously.  This requires higher resource utilization on the host
machine than the default configuration, which uses SQLite for
storage.

To run this configuration, you use `docker-compose.postgres.yml`
file:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up --build -d
```

To stop the service and destroy the containers, run:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml down
```

This configuration will persist data if the container is stopped
or destroyed.  If you would like to clear the data in the database,
and have it recreated from scratch the next time the application is started,
you can run the following commands:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml down
docker volume ls | grep inferno-pgdata # Lists active volumes
docker volume rm inferno-program_inferno-pgdata # Volume name will end in inferno-pgdata
```

For another example of deploying Inferno in a production environment, review
[the docker-compose file](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno.healthit.gov/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
used to deploy Inferno Program Edition, Inferno Community Edition, and a
number of services on https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno.

#### Upgrading Inferno

If an Inferno update makes changes to the database schema, migrations will have
to be run when updating. Run migrations with:

```sh
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

The above will migrate the development database. To migrate a production or test
database, use:

```sh
RACK_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate
RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

If you are using the provided inferno docker image, migrations will be run
automatically.

### Reference Implementation

While it is recommended that users install Inferno locally, a reference implementation of Inferno is hosted at https://inferno.healthit.gov

Users that would like to try out Inferno before installing locally can use that reference implementation, but should be forewarned that the database will be periodically refreshed and there is no guarantee that previous test runs will be available in perpetuity.

## Supported Browsers

Inferno has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.

## Unit Tests

Inferno contains a robust set of self-tests to ensure that the test clients conform to the specification and performs as intended.  To run these tests, execute the following command:

```sh
RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
bundle exec rake test
```

## Inspecting and Exporting Tests

Tests are written to be easily understood, even by those who aren't familiar with Ruby.  They can be
viewed directly [in this repository](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/tree/master/lib/modules).

Tests contain metadata that provide additional details and traceability to standards.  The active tests and related metadata can be exported into CSV format and saved to a file named `testlist.csv` with the following command:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv
```

Arguments can be provided to the task in order to export a specific set of tests or to specify the output file.

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv[onc,all_tests.csv]
```

To just choose the module and use the default groups and filename:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv[onc]

```

## Running Tests from the Command Line
Inferno provides two methods of running tests via the command line: by directly providing the sequences or running automated scripts

_Note: This feature is still in development and we are looking for feedback on features and improvements in ways it can be used_

### Running Tests Directly

Testing sequences can be run from the command line via a rake task which takes the sequence (or sequences) to be run and server url as arguments:
```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:execute[https://my-server.org/data,onc,ArgonautConformance]
```

### Running Automated Command Line Interface Scripts
For more complicated testing where passing arguments is unwieldy, Inferno provides the ability to use a script containing parameters to drive test execution.
The provided `example_script.json` shows an example of this script and how it can be used.  The `execute_batch` task runs the script:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:execute_batch[script.json]
```

Inferno also provides a  `generate_script` rake task which prompts the user for a series of inputs which are then used to generate a script.
The user is expected to provide a url for the FHIR Server to be tested and the module name from which sequences will be pulled.
```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:generate_script[https://my-server.org/data,onc]
```

### Caveats
* For `DynamicRegistration` users must provide instructions similar to that provided in `example_script.json` to automate the webdriver.
* The `confidential_client` field is a boolean and must be provided as `true` or `false`

## Using with Continuous Integration Systems
Instructions and examples are available in the [Continuous Integration Section of the Wiki](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Using-with-Continuous-Integration-Systems).
