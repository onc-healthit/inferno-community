AJCC codes (preferably, version 8 for current cancers) SHOULD be used.\n\n* AJCC terminology: examples of N categories include 'cN0', indicating no evidence of lymph node involvement, and 'pN1', indicating regional lymph node involvement to a small extent, with specific thresholds for the lymph node groups and number of lymph nodes involved. Other N categories refer to increasing lymph node involvement. Please note allowable N categories may vary between clinical and pathologic classifications. The full set of allowable clinical and pathologic N categories, along with its current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"urn:iso:std:iso:3166","code":"US","display":"United States of America"}]}],"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://cancerstaging.org"}]}}
