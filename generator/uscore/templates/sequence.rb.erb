        # Background

        The US Core #{title} sequence verifies that the system under test is able to provide correct responses
        for <%= resource %> queries.  These queries must contain resources conforming to <%= profile_name %> as specified
        in the US Core v3.1.0 Implementation Guide. <% if resource == 'Device' %>If the system under test contains Device
        resources that are not implantable, and therefore do not conform to the US Core Implantable Device profile,
        the tester should provide an Implantable Device Code to the test to ensure that only the appropriate device types
        are validated against this profile.<% end %>

        # Testing Methodology

        <% if resource == 'Provenance' %>
        Previously run sequences store references to US Core Provenance resources that are associated with other US Core
        resources using the appropriate `_revincludes` search.  This set of tests uses these found resources to verify
        support for the `read` operation.  Each of these resources must conform to the US Core Provenance profile.
        <% elsif delayed_sequence %>
        Because <%=resource%> resources are not present or do not exist in USCDI, no searches are performed on this test sequence. Instead, references to
        this profile found in other resources are used for testing. If no references can be found this way, then all the tests
        in this sequence are skipped.
        
        <%else%>
        ## Searching
        This test sequence will first perform each required search associated with this resource. This sequence will perform searches
        with the following parameters:
        <%searches.select { |search_param| search_param[:expectation] == 'SHALL' && search_param[:must_support_or_mandatory]}.each do |search| %>
          * <%=search[:names].join(' + ')%><%end%>

        <% if searches.any? {|search_param| search_param[:expectation] == 'SHALL' && !search_param[:must_support_or_mandatory]} %>
        Note that this test sequence does not include the following mandatory <%=resource%> search combinations because they search elements
        that are neither mandatory nor must support for the <%=profile_name%>:
        <%searches.select { |search_param| search_param[:expectation] == 'SHALL' && !search_param[:must_support_or_mandatory]}.each do |search| %>
          * <%=search[:names].join('+ ')%><%end%>
        <% end %>
        <% if resource == 'DiagnosticReport' %>
        Inferno will search by patient + category before doing a search by only patient in order to differentiate the two Diagnostic Report profiles. 
        <% end %>
        ### Search Parameters
        The first search uses the selected patient(s) from the prior launch sequence. Any subsequent searches will look for its 
        parameter values from the results of the first search. For example, the `identifier` search in the patient sequence is 
        performed by looking for an existing `Patient.identifier` from any of the resources returned in the `_id` search. If a 
        value cannot be found this way, the search is skipped.
        
        ### Search Validation
        Inferno will retrieve up to the first 20 bundle pages of the reply for <%=resource%> resources and save them 
        for subsequent tests.
        Each of these resources is then checked to see if it matches the searched parameters in accordance
        with [FHIR search guidelines](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html). The test will fail, for example, if a patient search 
        for gender=male returns a female patient. 
        <%end%>
        ## Must Support
        Each profile has a list of elements marked as "must support". This test sequence expects to see each of these elements
        at least once. If at least one cannot be found, the test will fail. The test will look through the <%=resource%>
        resources found for these elements.

        ## Profile Validation
        Each resource returned from the first search is expected to conform to the [<%=profile_name%>](<%=profile%>).
        Each element is checked against teminology binding and cardinality requirements.

        Elements with a required binding is validated against its bound valueset. If the code/system in the element is not part
        of the valueset, then the test will fail.

        ## Reference Validation
        Each reference within the resources found from the first search must resolve. The test will attempt to read each reference found 
        and will fail if any attempted read fails.
