      details %(
        This test ensures that patients are able to grant or deny access to a subset of resources to an app.
        It also verifies that patients can prevent issuance of a refresh token by denying the `offline_access` scope.  The tester provides a list of resources
        that will be granted during the SMART App Launch process, and this test verifies that the scopes granted
        are consistent with what the tester provided.  It also formulates queries to ensure that the app
        is either given access to, or denied access to, the appropriate resource types based on those chosen
        by the tester.
        
        Resources that can be mapped to USCDI are checked in this test, including:
        <% non_delayed_sequences.group_by{|sequence| sequence[:resource]}.values.map(&:first).each do |resource| %>
          * <%= resource[:resource]%><% end %>

        For each of the resources that can be mapped to USCDI data class or elements, this set of tests
        performs a minimum number of requests to determine if access to the resource type is appropriately allowed or denied given the
        scope granted.  In the case of the Patient resource, this test simply performs a read request.
        For other resources, it performs a search by patient that must be supported by the server.  In some cases,
        servers can return an error message if a status search parameter is not provided.  For these, the
        test will perform an additional search with the required status search parameter.

        This set of tests does not attempt to access resources that do not directly map to USCDI v1, including Encounter, Location,
        Organization, Practitioner, PractionerRole, and RelatedPerson.  It also does not test Provenance, as this
        resource type is accessed by queries through other resource types.  These resource types are accessed in the more
        comprehensive Single Patient Query tests.

        If the tester chooses to not grant access to a resource, the queries associated with that resource must
        result in either a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) status code.  The flexiblity provided here
        is due to some ambiguity in the specifications tested.

        This test ensures that apps have full access to USCDI resources if granted access by the tester.
        The tester must grant access to the following resources during the SMART Launch process,
        and this test ensures they all can be accessed:
        <% non_delayed_sequences.group_by{|sequence| sequence[:resource]}.values.map(&:first).each do |resource| %>

        However, the authorization system must indicate that access is granted to the Encounter, Practitioner and Organization
        resource types by providing them in the returned scopes because they are required to support the read interaction.
